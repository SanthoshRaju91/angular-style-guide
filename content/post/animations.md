Use subtle animations with Angular to transition between states for views and primary visual elements. Include the ngAnimate module. The 3 keys are subtle, smooth, seamless.

  1.	Subtle animations can improve User Experience when used appropriately.
  2.	Subtle animations can improve perceived performance as views transition.
  3.	Long animations can have the reverse effect on User Experience and perceived performance by giving the appearance of a slow application. Preferably  start with 300ms and adjust until appropriate.

There is a great css animation library called animate.css, it provides.

   1.	Fast, smooth, and easy to add animations to your application.
   2.	Provides consistency in your animations.
   3.	animate.css is widely used and tested.
